      "writeup": "For Internal Use - For Internal Distribution Only\n\nDecarbonisation at Tiong A: Simple Steps, Big Impact\nBy PCSB-PMA in collaboration with Carbon Management Division (CMD)\n\nWhat if a single valve could help us get closer to our 2030 climate goals? At Tiong A, a simple\nquestion led to a powerful answer showing that small, practical steps can deliver big wins for\nboth the environment and our business.\n\nA Persistent Challenge\nTiong A, part of the Peninsular Malaysia Asset (PMA) under PETRONAS Carigali Sdn. Bhd.\n(PCSB), recently underwent a major brownfield modification through the Integrated Bekok Oil\n(IBO) project. The goal was clear: reduce flaring and support PETRONAS Upstream's\ndecarbonisation journey.\nHowever, following the commissioning of the IBO project in October 2024, the team\nencountered an unexpected challenge that put their resolve and the project's objectives to the\ntest. Despite the upgrades and sufficient gas handling capacity, Tiong A's flaring levels\nremained persistently elevated, averaging up to 11 MMscf/d. This translated to 0.26 million\ntCO₂e per year, threatening Upstream's 2030 target to cap absolute GHG emissions at 17.25\nmillion tCO₂e.\n\nTeamwork and Technology in Action\nDetermined to tackle the issue, a multidisciplinary taskforce sprang into action. Their mission\nwas clear: to identify and eliminate non-routine flaring sources using solutions that were both\ncost-effective and practical.\nThe team's strategy blended data-driven analysis with hands-on fieldwork:\n• Acoustic emission testing allowed the team to \"listen\" for hidden leaks across all\nhigh-pressure flare sources, revealing issues that might otherwise go undetected.\n•\nP&ID reviews and thorough on-site valve inspections helped zero in on the most likely\ntrouble spots.\n• Through this rigorous investigation, the team pinpointed passing manual bypass and\ncontrol valves specifically PCV-135D and PCV-120A as the main contributors to\nexcessive flaring during normal operations.\n\nShort-term solution: During a one-day ESD shutdown in March 2025, the team temporarily\nblinded the PCV-135D manual bypass valve and recalibrated critical control valves. All actions\nwere risk-assessed and approved to ensure operational safety.\nLong-term solution: In June 2025, during a scheduled maintenance shutdown (MSD), the\nteam replaced the passing manual bypass valve, upgraded the PCV-135D trim, and adjusted\nthe PCV-120A stem, permanently addressing the root causes.\n\nResults That Matter\nThe impact of these targeted interventions was both immediate and far-reaching.\n\nPhase 1 saw flaring rates at Tiong A plummet from 11 MMscf/d to just 4 MMscf/d after the\ninitial blinding of the bypass valve and recalibration of controls. This single step alone\ntranslated into a reduction of 0.21 million tCO₂e per year, preventing an estimated RM32.19\nmillion in annual hydrocarbon losses that would have otherwise gone up in smoke.\nBuilding on this momentum, Phase 2 delivered even greater results. Permanent rectification\nduring the June 2025 maintenance shutdown further reduced flaring to an impressive 1.5\nMMscf/d, cutting an additional 0.073 million tCO₂e and saving another RM11.5 million per\nyear.\nThese achievements mean that Tiong A now consistently operates below its daily flaring limit\nof 1.7 MMscf/d, not only meeting but exceeding operational KPIs. More importantly, this\nsuccess story directly supports Upstream's 2030 target to cap absolute GHG emissions at\n17.25 million tCO₂e.\nA Blueprint for the Future\nThis initiative is more than a technical fix. It's a model for how Upstream can deliver on\n\"Systemic Shift #8: Operate it Right,\" maximising production while minimising carbon intensity.\nIt proves that operational efficiency and sustainability go hand-in-hand, and that every staff\nmember has a role to play in decarbonisation."
