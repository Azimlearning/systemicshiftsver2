FSV

FSV functions mainly as Standby Vessel to provide support
during Emergency response, Fire Fighting (vessel equipped
with FIFI) & Search & Rescue efforts. Vessel type could either
be General Purpose Vessel (GPV), Fast Crew Boat (FCB), or
Utility Vessel (UV). PCSB currently hired 26 FSV as base fleet.

For Internal Use - For Internal Distribution Only

Field Support Vessels (FSV) serve as standby units for offshore emergency response, firefighting, and search & rescue. These include General Purpose Vessels (GPV), Fast Crew Boats
(FCB), and Utility Vessels (UV). PCSB currently operates 26 FSVs as part of its base fleet.
To enhance operational efficiency and adaptability, a strategic shift was introduced—optimizing vessel deployment and transitioning toward smarter, more agile offshore
support.
