Step Change to deliver
Relaxation of standards allowing team to be creative in delivering workable
solutions
•

Simplify barrier requirement for collision management by performing detail risk
assessment with all party involved. For technical well collision, dispensation
obtained to only set one barrier despite passing safety valve in the neighbouring
high pressure well

•

Accepting certain risk related to critical well control equipment during drilling in
view that manual intervention is still available.

•

Overall 6 Technical Standard/ Deviations raised;
•Two on collision management for plug setting (PTS)
•Three on well control philosophy (PTS)
•One MOC to realise operational optimisation opportunity for conductor cleanout.

Design optimisation with actual information post sanction
•

Extensive rig-platfrom clash check eliminating requirement to perform major
modification for rig entry purposes.

•

Soft shallow formation limiting variable deck load, hence detail logistic planning
utilizing only 2 supply vessels is vital.

•

Revised completion design from tie-back monobore to cemented monobore to
improve overall completion performance.

•

Mitigated high pore pressure range between depleted and virgin pressure via
effective mud design and well bore strengthening resulting in no losses at high
overbalance drilling.

•

Application of downhole vibration tool and high performance drilling bit mitigating
requirement for multiple trip to reach section TD (total depth)

Innovative contractual solution
•

Learning from existing iRDC (integrated Rig, Drilling and Completion contract)
internally and from other operators used to develop new integrated rig and service
contract to benefit from volume of operation and ring-fenced scope.

•

With scope agreed upfront, contractor is able to quote a risk-free unit rate.

•

Introduced concept of bonus and malus to ensure all party strive for good
performance.

•

Any non-productive time is going to erode time allowance pledged by contractor prior
to commencement of work and any duration beyond this will follow weighted
discount formula and/or malus rate.

•

For performance, contractor may call for any service/ new technology within their
technology inventory to beat the original pledged duration of a well.

Why Fit-for-Purpose Standard and Strategic
Contracting Matter More Than Ever
The KNNAG Phase 3 Drilling Campaign

This campaign redefined upstream execution—delivering more wells, faster timelines, and smarter
solutions through bold innovation and strategic flexibility. With a Systemic Shifts mindset and the
right behaviors at the core, here’s how the team made it happen.
Section 1: Breaking the Mold – Standards Reimagined
Key Change:
Embraced a more risk tolerant mindset by ensuring fit-for-purpose standards implementation,
which enabled innovative, risk-assessed solutions.
Highlights:
•Conducted collaborative risk assessments for collision management, enabling safe and
informed decision-making.
•

Granted technical dispensation to allow a single barrier, despite intersecting a safety
valve in a neighboring high-pressure well.

•Accepted calculated risks in well control equipment, supported by the availability of manual
intervention.
•Raised six Technical Deviations:
•

Two related to collision management for plug setting (PTS)

•

Three related to well control philosophy (PTS)

•

One Management of Change (MOC) to realise operational optimisation

•

Impact:
Cost savings of MYR 12.3 million

opportunity for conductor cleanout

Section 2: Smarter Design – Optimization Post-Sanction
Key Change:
Design evolved based on actual field conditions rather than pre-sanction assumptions.
Highlights:
•Conducted extensive rig-platform clash checks, eliminating the need for major
modifications to accommodate rig entry.
•Revised completion design from tie-back to cemented monobore, leveraging proven success
from previous projects to enhance performance.
•Applied effective mud design and wellbore strengthening to manage high pore pressure
contrast between depleted and virgin zones, enabling safe high overbalance drilling with no
losses.

•Deployed downhole vibration tools and high-performance drilling bits to reduce friction
and improve drilling efficiency, minimizing the need for multiple trips and successfully reaching
section TD.
•Implemented a focused logistics plan utilizing only two supply vessels to manage restricted
deck load caused by soft shallow formations, ensuring safe and timely drilling operations
Impact:
Cost savings of MYR 34.5 million

Section 3: Contracting Reinvented – Performance-Driven Agreements
Key Change:
Shift from traditional contracts to integrated, performance-based models, specifically the
Integrated Rig, Drilling, and Completion Contract (iRDC).
Highlights:
•Introduced Defined Scope with Risk-Free Pricing, where contractors quote a unit rate based
on an agreed and ring-fenced scope, minimizing pricing uncertainty.
•Implemented a Bonus-Malus Performance Incentive System to reward contractors for
outperforming pledged timelines and penalize delays.
•Enforced Non-Productive Time (NPT) Accountability, where any NPT reduces the
contractor’s pre-committed time allowance, and excess duration triggers malus rates or
discounts.
•Enabled Technology Deployment Flexibility, allowing contractors to utilize any available
service or technology to improve well delivery time and earn performance bonuses.
Impact:
Cost savings of MYR 49.6 million.

And the results speak for themselves across safety, budget, timeline, and scope.

"Setting the Standard for Future Campaigns"
Kinabalu Phase 3 proved that with the right mindset and tools, technical limits can be challenged and surpassed—
leaving a legacy of efficiency, safety, and performance.
