Real Time Optimisation Through IAM Innovation
Upstream surveillance has entered a new era.
With Integrated Asset Management (IAM), teams are no longer bound by static
monitoring or delayed insights. They now operate in real time, making faster and
smarter decisions powered by live data and intelligent workflows.
This is not just a technology upgrade—it is a step change in how wells are
understood, managed, and optimised.

Overcoming Challenges at Kinabalu
IAM has been deployed across multiple fields, including recent applications at
KNNAG wells B07L, B07S, and B06T, where it helped address long standing
surveillance challenges:
•

KNNAG B07S: Slow ramp up due to water coning risk

•

KNNAG B07L: Controlled ramp up to prevent proppant production

•

Persistent metering mismatch: Discrepancy between production data and
export meter readings despite multiple recalibrations

These challenges once limited operational confidence and delayed decision making.
IAM turned that around.

How IAM Changed the Game
From static to dynamic monitoring
IAM integrated Active Well Surveillance (AWS) and Pressure Downhole Gauge (PDG) data
to enable real time well configuration, replacing manual and reactive practices.
From estimates to validated rates
Using the Vertical Lift Performance (VLP) method, IAM resolved mismatches between
production and export readings, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
From single point to multipoint validation
The Multiphase Flow Meter (MPFM) Validation Workflow compared wellhead gas meter data
with Flowing Tubing Head Pressure (FTHP) and PDG pressure readings, improving
confidence in bean up decisions.
From delayed response to early action
Live validation during operations helped detect water coning earlier, reducing risks and
capturing additional gains.

IAM-Driven Enhancements
•

Real time well rate estimation using AWS, and PDG enabled accurate export meter
matching, unlocking 3 MMSCFD from KNNAG B06T

•

MPFM validation workflow identified KNNAG B07S for further bean up, with live
Wellhead Gas Meter (WGM) monitoring during execution

•

Ramp up strategies for B07S and B07L were optimised to mitigate water
coning and proppant production risks, improving zone contribution

The results speak for themselves:
•

23 MMSCFD in additional gas production

•

1 KBOED from the most productive condensate line up identified through IAM

•

Greater precision and confidence in surveillance and decision making

IAM has proven to be more than a modelling tool. It is a strategic enabler that drives
operational excellence.

What’s Next
The next step is clear: scaling IAM across all PCSB assets.
This will transform surveillance into a proactive, predictive, and performance driven
discipline, setting a new benchmark for upstream operations.
The future of optimisation is here.
And it is happening in real time.
