For Internal Use - For Internal Distribution Only

The Future Is Here —
EPIC 2.0
Turning Data Chaos into Exploration Clarity
Imagine this: You’re deep into a challenging exploration project. The data is
massive, the geology is complex, and deadlines are tight. What if you had a digital
powerhouse that could process seismic data, simulate reservoirs, and help you
make smarter decisions—all at lightning speed?
That’s what EPIC 2.0 brings to PETRONAS Upstream and Petroleum Arrangement
Contractors (PACs) in Malaysia. And as of 25 September 2025, it’s officially live.

What Is EPIC 2.0
EPIC 2.0 stands for Enterprise Platform for Integrated Computing. It is our nextgeneration High Performance Computing (HPC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
platform, built to handle the scale and complexity of modern upstream
challenges—from seismic imaging to reservoir modelling—with speed, precision,
and intelligence.
Key Capabilities
•

Sharper subsurface imaging
Supports Elastic Full Waveform Inversion (EFWI), using pressure and shear
wavefields to deliver high-resolution subsurface models in complex
geological settings.

•

Smart, integrated Earth models
Combines static and dynamic reservoir data with AI-driven interpretation to
improve decision-making and streamline workflows. Includes enhanced
model resolution, faster simulation runtimes, and scalable support for
history matching and predictive modelling.

•

Accelerated processing
Combines large-scale parallel computing, GPU acceleration, and optimised
input/output strategies to reduce turnaround time from days to hours.

•

Optimised for internal innovation
Runs PETRONAS proprietary algorithms at scale, turning internal technology
into a competitive edge.

Go-Live Milestone

For Internal Use - For Internal Distribution Only

EPIC 2.0 went live on 25 September 2025, supporting high-priority projects
in Suriname, Turkmenistan, PM419, and SB409. This milestone was delivered
through collaboration between Product Delivery Upstream, Upstream Technology
Data and Innovation, and Group Procurement PT and HSSE.
A full rollout is planned by mid-December 2025, with EPIC 2.0 ready to meet
seismic imaging demand projected to reach 85,000 km² between 2025 and 2028.
It also complements EPIC 1.0, which is currently operating at 80 to 90 percent
utilization. By adding parallel processing capabilities, EPIC 2.0 ensures sustained
performance for increasingly complex imaging operations.

Strategic Technology Partnerships Powering Sustainability
EPIC 2.0 is powered by DUG’s world-class HPC platform and its advanced MultiParameter Full Waveform Inversion seismic technologies. This foundation brings
cutting-edge seismic processing capabilities and sustainability features to
PETRONAS.
DUG’s expertise enhances imaging precision and turnaround speed for critical
exploration zones, while supporting PETRONAS internal innovation.
EPIC 2.0 is also engineered for efficiency and environmental responsibility.
•

Immersion cooling system
Servers are submerged in thermally conductive dielectric fluid, enabling
direct-to-chip heat removal. This method improves heat transfer, reduces
cooling energy use by up to 90 percent, and enhances hardware reliability.

•

PETRONAS-developed thermal fluids
These fluids reduce overall power consumption by up to 50 percent and are
being progressively adopted to optimise performance and sustainability.

A Platform for the Future
EPIC 2.0 is more than a technology upgrade—it’s a shift in how we work.
