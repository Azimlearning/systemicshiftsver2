Decarbonisation at Tiong A: Simple Steps, Big Impact
By PCSB-PMA in collaboration with Carbon Management Division (CMD)

What if a single valve could help us get closer to our 2030 climate goals? At Tiong A, a simple
question led to a powerful answer showing that small, practical steps can deliver big wins for
both the environment and our business.

A Persistent Challenge
Tiong A, part of the Peninsular Malaysia Asset (PMA) under PETRONAS Carigali Sdn. Bhd.
(PCSB), recently underwent a major brownfield modification through the Integrated Bekok Oil
(IBO) project. The goal was clear: reduce flaring and support PETRONAS Upstream’s
decarbonisation journey.
Tiong A, part of PM9 fields under Peninsular Malaysia Asset (PMA) operated by PETRONAS
Carigali Sdn. Bhd. (PCSB), recently underwent a major brownfield modification through the
PM9 Simplification (PM9S) project. The goal was clear: reduce flaring and support
PETRONAS Upstream’s decarbonisation journey. reducing long term PM9 OPEX and reduce
overall PM9 PSC GHG Emission
However, following the commissioning of the IBO project in October 2024, the team
encountered an unexpected challenge that put their resolve and the project’s objectives to the
test. Despite the upgrades and sufficient gas handling capacity, Tiong A’s flaring levels
remained persistently elevated, averaging up to 11 MMscf/d. This translated to 0.26 million
tCO₂e per year, threatening Upstream’s 2030 target to cap absolute GHG emissions at 17.25
million tCO₂e.

Teamwork and Technology in Action
Determined to tackle the issue, a multidisciplinary taskforce sprang into action. Their mission
was clear: to identify and eliminate non-routine flaring sources using solutions that were both
cost-effective and practical.
The team’s strategy blended data-driven analysis with hands-on fieldwork:
• Acoustic emission testing allowed the team to “listen” for hidden leaks across all
high-pressure flare sources, revealing issues that might otherwise go undetected.
•
P&ID reviews and thorough on-site valve inspections helped zero in on the most likely
trouble spots.
• Through this rigorous investigation, the team pinpointed passing manual bypass and
control valves specifically PCV-135D and PCV-120A as the main contributors to
excessive flaring during normal operations.

Short-term solution: During a one-day ESD shutdown in March 2025, the team temporarily
blinded the PCV-135D manual bypass valve and recalibrated critical control valves. All actions
were risk-assessed and approved to ensure operational safety.
Long-term solution: In June 2025, during a scheduled maintenance shutdown (MSD), the
team replaced the passing manual bypass valve, upgraded the PCV-135D trim, and adjusted
the PCV-120A stem, permanently addressing the root causes.

Results That Matter
The impact of these targeted interventions was both immediate and far-reaching.

For Internal Use - For Internal Distribution Only

Phase 1 saw flaring rates at Tiong A plummet from 11 MMscf/d to just 4 MMscf/d after the
initial blinding of the bypass valve and recalibration of controls. This single step alone
translated into a reduction of 0.21 million tCO₂e per year, preventing an estimated RM32.19
million in annual hydrocarbon losses that would have otherwise gone up in smoke.
Building on this momentum, Phase 2 delivered even greater results. Permanent rectification
during the June 2025 maintenance shutdown further reduced flaring to an impressive 1.5
MMscf/d, cutting an additional 0.073 million tCO₂e and saving another RM11.5 million per
year.
These achievements mean that Tiong A now consistently operates below its daily flaring limit
of 1.7 MMscf/d, not only meeting but exceeding operational KPIs. More importantly, this
success story directly supports Upstream’s 2030 target to cap absolute GHG emissions at
17.25 million tCO₂e.
A Blueprint for the Future
This initiative is more than a technical fix. It’s a model for how Upstream can deliver on
“Systemic Shift #8: Operate it Right,” maximising production while minimising carbon intensity.
It proves that operational efficiency and sustainability go hand-in-hand, and that every staff
member has a role to play in decarbonisation.
